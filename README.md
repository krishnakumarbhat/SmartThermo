# SmartThermo
Temperature Control System with Linear Regression and DHT11 Sensor
This project is designed to control the temperature in a room using an 8051 microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor. The system utilizes a linear regression algorithm to predict the temperature based on historical data and adjusts the thermostat accordingly to maintain a comfortable temperature. In addition, LED indicators provide visual feedback on the current state of the system.

Hardware Requirements
The following hardware components are required for this project:

8051 microcontroller
DHT11 sensor
Relay module for the thermostat
LED indicators
LCD display (optional)
Software Requirements
The following software components are required for this project:

Keil version 5
Arduino IDE
DHT11 library for Arduino
Installation and Usage
Connect the DHT11 sensor to the 8051 microcontroller.
Upload the code to the 8051 microcontroller using Keil IDE.
Connect the relay module to the microcontroller for thermostat control.
Connect the LED indicators to the microcontroller for visual feedback.
Power on the microcontroller and monitor the temperature on the LCD display (if connected).
